Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up an macOS laptop for web / mobile / server development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Credits
-------

This laptop script is based on
[thoughbot's laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) script and has
simply been customized to our needs.

Older versions may work but aren't necessarily tested.
